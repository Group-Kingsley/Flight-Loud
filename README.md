Overview
Description

This is an app that enables users to keep track of fights in their wishlist for when the prices drop.

App Evaluation

Category: Travel
Mobile: The app is inherently mobile, making use of real-time flight data, location services to customize notifications based on the user’s current or desired location, and push notifications to alert users to price drops. Integrating maps to show nearby airports or the route to the destination would also enhance the user experience.

Story: The story here is compelling for travelers looking to save money on flights. It’s clear that users would find value in getting instant updates on price changes, which would make booking flights more convenient and budget-friendly. This app could also appeal to those who like spontaneous travel but want to do so without breaking the bank.

Market: The market is sizable as there are millions of frequent and occasional travelers who seek deals on flights. This app competes with existing services like Google Flights and Hopper, but offering a more tailored experience (e.g., specific alerts for price drops to a desired location) could differentiate it. While there is strong competition, a well-defined audience of budget travelers could give the app a strong foothold.

Habit: This app could be habit-forming for users who frequently search for flights and want to stay updated on the best prices. The frequency of app use would depend on the user's travel plans, but with push notifications, users are likely to open the app at least once a day to check for price updates.

Scope: The scope is feasible with a core version that tracks flight prices and sends alerts. The app would need access to reliable data sources for flights (e.g., Skyscanner API, Kiwi.com API, or other travel search engines). Adding advanced features like predictive pricing algorithms could add complexity.
